# RK WHMCS Utils

A quick slap-together of views I needed to make sense of a WHMCS instance:

- Customer Overview: show active WHMCS clients, their active 
  domains+services, affiliates+fees, VAT fees (assuming VAT inclusive),
  gross monthly revenue

- eNom Check: Compare domains from eNom and WHMCS and show problems

Tested with PHP 8.1.

Special BackenderÂ® Design.

## Setting up

1. Copy `config.example.php` to `config.php` and edit as needed
2. Run `composer install` to get dependencies
3. Put everything in a subdirectory of the WHMCS instance, for instance https://mydomain.com/whmcs-root/utils/

## Development

Just run `php -S localhost:8080` and point your browser to it.

## Bugs

- Hardcoded VAT rate of 20%
- Probably some bugs matching users to clients and vice versa
